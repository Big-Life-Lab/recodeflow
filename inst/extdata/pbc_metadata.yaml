description: |
  Primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disease leading to
  destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver.  Progression is
  slow but inexhortable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver
  decompensation.
  The condition has been recognised since at least 1851 and was named
  "primary biliary cirrhosis" in 1949.
  Because cirrhosis is a feature only of advanced disease, a change of
  its name to "primary biliary cholangitis" was proposed by patient
  advocacy groups in 2014.
  This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between 1974
  and 1984.
  A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year
  interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled
  trial of the drug D-penicillamine.  The first 312 cases in the data set
  participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data.  The
  additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial, but consented
  to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.  Six of
  those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the data here
  are on an additional 106 cases as well as the 312 randomized participants.
