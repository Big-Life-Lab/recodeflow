# Scope and specifications for labels and metadata in `recodeflow`

This document outlines the scope and key technical requirements for improving how **`recodeflow`** handles variable and value labels (metadata). The primary objectives are:

-   **Enable reproducible, standardized metadata**: Use proven conventions from `` `haven` `` and `` `labelled` `` so that data analysts can apply labels consistently in R.
-   **Facilitate collaboration**: Store metadata in human-readable CSV sidecars (`variables` and `variable_details`) for project teams, including those who are not R users.
-   **Support data transformations**: Preserve labels as data is pivoted, joined, or subsetted, while respecting the changing context of variables.
-   **Plan for future needs**: Align with existing R ecosystem packages and keep open the possibility of supporting DDI, LinkML, or extended role-based metadata in subsequent releases.

## 1. Integration with the R ecosystem

The label system in `recodeflow` will rely on **existing standards** from packages like `` `haven` `` and `` `labelled` ``: - Use `attr(x, "label")` to store the variable label (e.g., `"Age of respondent"`). - Use `attr(x, "labels")` (with class `` `haven`_`labelled` ``) to store **value labels** (e.g., `0 = "Censored"`, `1 = "Transplant"`). - Avoid duplicating existing functions for applying labels. Instead, harness utilities such as `` `labelled`::var_label() `` and `` `labelled`::val_labels() ``, and provide **wrapper functions** only if they add new `recodeflow`-specific features (e.g., syncing sidecar metadata).

This ensures that data frames processed by `recodeflow` remain fully compatible with tidyverse tools, while also allowing export to SPSS or Stata with labels intact via `` `haven`::write_sav() `` or `` `haven`::write_dta() ``.

## 2. Basic usage example with the PBC dataset

To illustrate label handling, consider a minimal example:

``` r
# Sample PBC dataset
data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  status = c(0, 1, 2, 0, 2)
)

# Base R approach
attr(data$status, "label") <- "Patient status"
attr(data$status, "labels") <- c("Censored" = 0, "Transplant" = 1, "Dead" = 2)

# `labelled` package approach
library(`labelled`)
data <- set_variable_labels(data, status = "Patient status")
data$status <- set_value_labels(data$status,
                                `Censored` = 0,
                                `Transplant` = 1,
                                `Dead` = 2)
```

## 3. Support for variable and value labels

```         
1.  Variable labels: Short textual descriptions for the meaning of each column (e.g., "Patient status").
2.  Value labels: Descriptive mappings for the coded values of a variable (e.g., 0 = "Censored", 1 = "Transplant", 2 = "Dead").
```

Both sets of labels will be: • Stored in the sidecar CSV files: the “single source of truth” for metadata that non-R users can edit. • Applied as R attributes to the data frame so that labelling remains intact for analysis or export.

Whenever a user updates labels via R, `recodeflow` can update the CSV metadata to remain consistent (and vice versa).

## 4. Performance, import, and export

Performance: • Label attributes are lightweight (often just a single string or a small named vector). • Bulk operations (e.g., setting labels on an entire dataset) will help avoid repeated overhead.

Import/export: • CSV-first: For day-to-day collaboration, CSV remains the easiest way to share metadata with non-R stakeholders. • Additional formats: DDI (XML) or LinkML (YAML/JSON) could be supported in future expansions, letting advanced users integrate with metadata repositories or codebook standards. • SPSS/Stata: By adhering to `haven`\_`labelled`, `recodeflow` automatically preserves labels in .sav and .dta exports.

## 5. Relationship to tagged NA functionality

`recodeflow` will accommodate `haven`::tagged_na() to represent multiple missing data categories (e.g., NA(a) for “not applicable”). Labels can be assigned to these tagged values just as they would be to any other numeric code. A separate tagged-NA specification will detail how to classify different missingness types in the sidecar (e.g., 99 = “Refused”) and convert them automatically into tagged_na('x') in R. Labels help clarify the meaning of each missing code in data dictionaries or codebooks.

## 6. Versioning and extensibility

Versioning: • Use GitHub releases to manage changes to label functionality. • Encourage storing sidecar CSV files under version control so label history can be diffed.

Extensibility: • Additional fields (e.g., short/long labels, notes, or variable roles) can be appended in the sidecar files (variables, variable_details) without requiring changes to the data frame attributes. • Only essential attributes (short label, value labels) will be stored in R to avoid bloat or attribute loss during transformations.

## 7. Conclusion

By standardizing how labels are assigned, stored, and preserved, `recodeflow` will streamline metadata management for data harmonization projects. Integrating with `haven` and `labelled` ensures minimal redundancy, while CSV-based sidecar files guarantee accessibility for non-R collaborators. Future steps can include DDI or LinkML export, enhanced versioning, and more robust transformation tracking. In the meantime, these core specifications will provide a solid foundation for a clear, dependable label management system.

# Appendix

A longer version of the specifications

## 1. Integration with the R ecosystem

**Leverage existing standards**: The label system in `recodeflow` should be built to integrate seamlessly with R’s established labeling tools, particularly the `labelled` and `haven` packages. These packages already define classes and conventions for labeled data (e.g., the `haven`\_`labelled` class for vectors with value labels) and provide functions to manipulate labels ￼ . To minimize maintenance overhead and maximize compatibility, `recodeflow` will reuse these conventions instead of creating a new, redundant labeling system. For example:

-   Use the label attribute on vectors to store a variable label (a human-readable description of the variable).

-   Use the labels attribute (with class `haven`\_`labelled`) to store value labels (a mapping from numeric or character codes to text) for categorical variables ￼.

-   Rely on functions from `labelled` (and potentially sj`labelled`) for common operations like setting or retrieving labels, rather than duplicating their functionality, unless a specific enhancement is needed. For instance, `labelled`::var_label() and `labelled`::val_labels() can be used under the hood for applying labels ￼￼.

By aligning with these standards, `recodeflow` ensures that labeled data objects remain **compatible with other R packages** and workflows. A data frame labeled by `recodeflow` should behave like any other labeled data frame: users can view labels in RStudio’s data viewer, use tidyverse functions on them, or export them to SPSS/Stata through `haven` without losing information. This also means avoiding introducing new S3 classes for labeled data if the existing `haven`\_`labelled` class suffices, thereby reducing complexity. Redundant functionality will be avoided – for example, we won’t write a new factor-to-label converter if `haven`::as_factor() already does it, unless there’s a compelling reason to deviate. In summary, integration with the R ecosystem will make `recodeflow`’s labeling familiar, reliable, and low-maintenance, building on proven tools ￼.

## 2. Support for variable and value labels

Both variable and value labels will be fully supported, as each serves a different purpose in data documentation. A variable label is a short description of the meaning of a column (variable), whereas value labels provide descriptive text for the coded values that a variable can take (especially important for categorical or factor-like variables) ￼. `recodeflow` will implement systems for both:

-   **Variable Labels:** Each variable can have a single descriptive label (and potentially a longer description or definition separately). For example, a column age might have a variable label “Age of respondent (years)”. These will be stored as an attribute (e.g., `attr(da$age, "label") = "Age of respondent (years)"`) and also recorded in the metadata sidecar (the variables sheet) so that the information is centralized. User-friendly functions will be provided to set and get these labels (e.g., `set_variable_label(data, var, label) and get_variable_label(data, var)`), likely as wrappers around existing functions for convenience. This ensures that assigning a label updates both the R object and the metadata sidecar for consistency.

-   **Value Labels:** For categorical or coded variables, each distinct value can have a label. For instance, a variable sex might have values 1 and 2 labeled as “Male” and “Female”. These mappings will be stored in the data as a labels attribute (e.g., `attr(data$sex, "labels") = c(Male = 1, Female = 2)` following the `haven` `labelled` format). Simultaneously, they will be documented in the variable_details metadata sidecar, which might contain a list of permissible values and their labels for each variable. Functions such as `set_value_labels(var, labels_vector)` and `get_value_labels(var)` will be provided for ease of manipulation. The implementation will ensure that categorical variables are properly labeled in any outputs or analyses (for example, printing a `labelled` vector in R shows the labels in brackets next to values).

**Storage approach:** The primary storage of these labels will be in the metadata sidecars (variables.csv and variable_details.csv), which act as the single source of truth for all metadata. When data is loaded or recoded with `recodeflow`, those labels will be applied to the R data frame as attributes. This dual storage ensures that:

-   Non-R users can read and edit labels in the CSV metadata files (which are human-readable and can be opened in spreadsheet software).
-   R users have the convenience of label attributes within the data frame for quick reference and integration with other R functions.

By keeping the authoritative labels in the sidecar, we avoid divergence between the data object and its documented metadata. If labels are updated via R functions, `recodeflow` will also update the sidecar files (or alert the user to do so) to maintain consistency. Conversely, if the CSV metadata is changed (e.g., a team member updates a label in variables.csv outside of R), re-importing or re-applying the metadata will update the R object’s labels accordingly. This design balances flexibility with consistency.

Additionally, `recodeflow` will support partial labeling (labeling only some values of a variable). This means a variable can have value labels for certain codes while other codes remain unlabeled, as allowed by the `haven` `labelled` structure ￼. Such variables will not be forced to become factors (which require a label for every level); instead, they remain in their native type with a labels attribute. This is useful for large numeric codes where only special values (e.g., 99 = “Unknown”) need labeling. Users will have the ability to add or remove specific value labels easily (similar to `labelled::val_label() functionality`).

In summary, `recodeflow` will treat variable labels and value labels as first-class metadata, storing them in both the sidecar and as attributes. Clear APIs for setting, getting, and modifying these labels ensure efficiency and reduce manual effort. Proper labeling of categorical data will be enforced so that any factor or coded variable has an accompanying label set, improving the interpretability of harmonized datasets.

## 3. Performance considerations

Handling labels should not significantly degrade performance, even for large datasets. Optimizations will be built into label storage and manipulation to minimize memory and CPU overhead:

-   **Memory efficiency:** Storing labels as attributes (which are essentially small vectors or strings attached to each column) is generally lightweight. A variable label is just a single string, and value labels are a vector of label mappings which, in most cases, is much smaller than the data itself (since it only has one entry per unique code). We will ensure that these attributes are only as large as necessary and avoid duplicating data. For example, if a variable has 100 possible values but only 5 are actually labeled, we will only store those 5 label pairs, not all 100 values. This is consistent with how `haven`\_`labelled` works (labels need not be exhaustive) ￼. For extremely large taxonomies or code lists, we will document best practices (such as using factors or reference tables) to avoid enormous in-memory label vectors.

-   **Avoiding data copies:** In R, adding or modifying attributes to a vector can sometimes trigger a copy of that vector in memory. To mitigate this, `recodeflow` will try to set labels at the time of variable creation or recoding (so that attributes are added before the variable is used widely, reducing duplication in memory). Bulk operations will be used where possible – for instance, applying variable labels to all data frame columns in a single function call, rather than iterating over columns in R, to leverage vectorized internal operations. The set_data_labels() function (or its improved equivalent) will label an entire dataset in one go, which is more efficient than labeling column-by-column in a loop ￼.

-   **Efficient lookup and manipulation:** Functions to get or set labels will be optimized to avoid unnecessary data scanning. Retrieving a label should be near O(1) (constant time) since it can directly fetch the attribute or look up in a keyed sidecar table. Setting a label will typically be O(1) for a variable label (assign an attribute) or O(m) for m labels in a value labels vector (which is usually small). We will also consider using `data.table` or keyed `tibbles` for the sidecar metadata to allow fast joins or lookups by variable name when applying labels to data, ensuring that even if there are thousands of variables, the labeling operation remains fast.

-   **Lazy operations when appropriate:** If applying all labels to a dataset is too slow or memory-intensive for extremely large data, we might implement a lazy approach (for future enhancement) where labels are loaded on demand. However, since label metadata is relatively small, this is generally unnecessary. Instead, we make sure that applying labels (which involves adding a few attributes per column) is negligible compared to typical data processing tasks. In practical terms, labeling a 1GB dataset should not appreciably increase its memory footprint, as only metadata is added.

-   **No bottlenecks in data processing:** Label operations will be designed to avoid becoming the rate-limiting step of a pipeline. For example, if a user is recoding 100 variables across 10 datasets, the recoding (data transformation) will likely be the heavy part, and adding labels should be minor overhead. We will test `recodeflow` on large datasets to ensure that functions like `merge_rec_data()` or `rec_with_table()` remain fast even with labels involved ￼. The internal algorithms will avoid quadratic complexity operations on label metadata (e.g., no nested loops over data rows for labeling).

In summary, labelling implementation will be mindful of performance: adding rich metadata should not trade off the ability to handle large-scale harmonization. We will optimize at the attribute level and use efficient data structures for metadata. Additionally, thorough testing and possible profiling will be conducted to ensure that common operations (label application, retrieval, export) are efficient. Any identified bottlenecks will be documented with recommendations (for instance, if a certain operation is slow, suggest an alternative workflow). The goal is to make label handling virtually transparent in terms of speed and memory, so users get the benefit of labels without any downsides.

## 4. Export and import compatibility

To facilitate collaboration and transparency, `recodeflow` will support multiple formats for exporting and importing labeled data and metadata. The strategy is to use a CSV-first approach for simplicity, while also integrating with formal metadata standards for advanced use cases.

-   **CSV as primary export:** The primary export format for metadata will remain CSV (comma-separated values). The variables and variable_details sheets are essentially CSV files that document the metadata (variable names, labels, coding instructions, etc.), and this will continue to be a cornerstone. CSV is chosen because it is easy to open and edit by team members who may not use R. A data steward can update labels or descriptions in a spreadsheet or text editor, and those changes can be read back into R. We will provide functions like export_metadata_csv() to write out the latest variables/variable_details from R, and import_metadata_csv() to read them in, ensuring a smooth round-trip. The format of these CSVs will be clearly documented so that even without using R, one can understand them (column names for variable, label, etc., and how categorical mappings are recorded). By using CSV, we ensure accessibility and transparency of the metadata, aligning with open science practices.

-   **Support for DDI (Data Documentation Initiative):** We plan to (re)introduce support for exporting and importing metadata in the DDI Codebook format (an XML standard widely used for survey metadata and data dictionaries). DDI is useful for more sophisticated documentation needs, archival, or integration with metadata repositories. In future versions of `recodeflow`, a function like `export_metadata_ddi()` could generate a DDI XML file from the variables and variable_details data. This would include variable labels, categories (value labels), descriptions, and possibly dataset-level information, structured according to the DDI specification (e.g., <variable> elements within a <codeBook>). Conversely, `import_metadata_ddi()` could read a DDI XML and populate the `recodeflow` metadata structures. This opens the door for interoperability with tools outside R. For example, a codebook created in another system (or an existing DDI file for a survey) could be imported to initialize `recodeflow`’s metadata. The design will consider using existing packages or utilities (like DDIwR or IPUMS’s DDI reader) to avoid reinventing the wheel ￼. DDI support will be made optional (since not all users need it), but the architecture will allow plugging it in without affecting core CSV workflows.

-   **Future compatibility with LinkML:** We recognize the emerging importance of LinkML (Linked Modeling Language) for metadata management. LinkML allows one to define a schema/metadata in YAML and then output it in various formats including JSON, JSON-Schema, SQL DDL, and even connect to ontologies ￼. As a forward-looking plan, we intend to design `recodeflow` metadata structures in a way that could be mapped to a LinkML schema. In the future, this could enable exporting metadata to JSON or YAML (for integration with web applications or APIs), generating SQL statements to create database tables with labels and constraints, or linking variables to ontologies or standardized vocabularies. For example, using LinkML, a variable definition in `recodeflow` could be converted into a JSON Schema property with an enum of coded values and their descriptions or into documentation that links a variable to a concept ID in an ontology. While direct LinkML integration is not in the immediate scope, we will keep the door open by structuring our metadata clearly (no R-specific quirks that wouldn’t translate). The team may collaborate with metadata experts to eventually provide an `export_metadata_linkml()` function, which could output a YAML schema following LinkML standards, making the metadata machine actionable in broader ecosystems.

-   **Other Formats:** In addition to CSV, DDI, and future LinkML, we will ensure basic compatibility with common data formats. For instance, when exporting a labeled dataset to SPSS or Stata using `haven::write_sav()` or `write_dta()`, the variable and value labels stored as attributes will be correctly written into those files (since `haven` will take care of embedding labels). This essentially means that the label functionality we implement will directly benefit those exports because we adhere to `haven`’s conventions. We will test that a round-trip (`import SPSS -> recodeflow -> export SPSS`) preserves labels. Likewise, if exporting to plain CSV data, we will offer the option to produce a companion CSV or JSON that contains the metadata, because plain CSV cannot carry attributes. This could be a simple documentation file (e.g., a codebook CSV with columns for variable name, label, and value label mappings) that can accompany the data.

In summary, `recodeflow`’s labeling system will be highly interoperable. By using CSV as the default, we ensure ease of use for collaborators without specialized tools. By planning for DDI and LinkML, we align with international standards and future-proof the metadata handling. These exports also ensure that metadata remains useful outside of R, promoting collaboration and longevity of data documentation. Clear documentation and examples will be provided for each supported format so users can easily utilize them.

## 5. Relationship to tagged NA

`recodeflow` must ensure that its labeling mechanism works seamlessly with missing value handling, especially the `haven`::tagged_na() system for representing multiple types of missing data. In surveys and harmonized datasets, it’s common to have special missing codes (e.g., “Refused”, “Not applicable”, “Don’t know”), and `haven`’s tagged NAs are the R way to encode these while preserving their distinct meanings ￼. Although comprehensive support for tagged NAs will be addressed in a separate specification, the label functionality will be designed to be fully compatible with it:

-   **Labeling of missing values:** `haven` and `labelled` packages treat user-defined missing values as just another labeled value, often with a tag or special class (for SPSS) to denote them ￼. `recodeflow` will adopt the same principle. If a value is meant to signify a missing category (e.g., `99 = “Refused”`), this should be labeled like any other value, and ideally marked as a missing type rather than a valid value. For instance, if using `haven::tagged_na('x')` for “Refused”, the value label “Refused” will be associated with that tagged NA value. Our functions to set value labels will allow tagged NAs as values. Example: `set_value_labels(data$income, c("Not applicable" = tagged_na('a')))` could label NA(a) as “Not applicable”. The metadata sidecar should also reflect this (perhaps with a flag in variable_details indicating that a code is considered missing). This way, anyone reviewing the CSV metadata will see, for example, code 99 labeled “Refused (missing)”, and in R the data will actually contain NA with a tag or some representation consistent with that.

-   **No Interference with tagged NAs**: Operations on labels will not remove or corrupt tagged NA values. For instance, if a variable contains NA(b) to indicate some missing category, setting or getting labels for that variable should not turn NA(b) into a regular NA or a numeric code. The underlying data type remains the same. Our implementation will recognize `haven`’s tagged NA class and handle it accordingly. If we summarize or print labeled data, we will rely on haven/labelled print methods that already know how to display tagged NAs (showing NA(b) etc.) ￼. If any custom processing is done, the NA status will be preserved. In essence, tagged NAs will be treated as a valid “value” in the value labels vector (so they can have a label), but we won’t inadvertently treat them as ordinary values.

-   **Clear specification for missing in metadata:** The specification will clarify how to denote missing values in `variables.csv` or `variable_details.csv`. For example, we may decide that within the metadata, a certain column (or perhaps a special notation in the labels) indicates missing. Some systems use an annotation like “” next to the label. We might introduce a convention such as: if a value label is enclosed in brackets or flagged in an additional column (e.g., a boolean missing column), `recodeflow` will know to handle that code as missing. This detail will be ironed out in the tagged NA feature, but the label functionality will be aware of it. The result should be that if a user marks a code as missing in the metadata, after applying labels, the R data’s values for that code are converted to NA (with tag if needed) and carry the appropriate label. For SPSS-like user missing values, we will consider using the class `haven`\_`labelled`\_spss which allows storing a separate na_values attribute for truly round-trip compatibility ￼, but even if not, the combination of tagged NA and label will serve the purpose.

-   **User guidance:** In documentation, we will explicitly guide users on how to use missing tags with labels. For instance: “If you want to label a special missing value, assign it a tag and a label. `recodeflow` will ensure it’s treated as NA in analyses but retains the label for reporting.” We will also mention that base R functions treat all NAs alike (so, e.g., `is.na()` returns `TRUE` for any tagged NA) ￼, but our metadata allows differentiation when needed (via the tag or label). Examples and edge cases (like sorting a vector with tagged NAs, or merging data with different missing codes) will be covered in the tagged NA documentation, with cross-references in the labeling guide.

In summary, tagged NA support and labeling will be harmonized. A labeled dataset in `recodeflow` can cleanly include multiple types of missing values with their own labels, without conflict. The label implementation will not preclude any planned missing data features; rather, it will complement them by providing the human-readable descriptors of what those missing codes mean. This ensures that when the separate missing data handling is introduced, it plugs into the labeling system effortlessly. (For example, a function to convert user-missing codes to NA could automatically carry over the label to the tagged NA value using our label assignment functions.) Even though tagged NA is specified separately, this document acknowledges its relevance so that we design labels with missing data in mind from the start.

6.  Versioning strategy

`recodeflow` will continue to use GitHub-based versioning for the package to manage releases of the labeling functionality, and we will consider mechanisms for tracking changes to labels over time as part of metadata version control.

-   **Package versioning:** The version of `recodeflow` (e.g., 0.2.0, 0.3.0, etc.) will increment as label functionality is added and improved. This follows semantic versioning principles to some extent (minor version bumps for new features, patch for bug fixes, etc.). The source of truth for the package version is the DESCRIPTION file and GitHub tags/releases. For example, when the label feature is first introduced, we might release `recodeflow` v0.X.0. Subsequent refinements or additions (like DDI export or LinkML integration) would be reflected in new version releases. We will document in the NEWS file or changelog what changes occur with labels in each version. Using GitHub also means we can leverage the Git history to see changes in code related to labeling, which is helpful for developers and advanced users.

-   **Metadata versioning / Tracking Label Changes:** While GitHub versioning covers the package, another aspect is tracking changes in the metadata (labels) themselves throughout a project. In collaborative projects, labels might be revised (e.g., a category label renamed for clarity). It’s important to consider how one might track those modifications. Although a fully automated version control system for metadata is beyond the initial scope (due to resource constraints), we encourage using Git or other VCS on the metadata CSV files as well. For example, if variables.csv is stored in a repository, label changes can be diffed and attributed to specific commits. We will recommend this practice in documentation as a stop-gap solution for metadata version tracking.

-   **Future enhancement - label history:** In the future, we might implement features to log changes to labels within `recodeflow`. One idea is to maintain a history table of label edits, perhaps as an attribute of the metadata sidecar or in a separate log file (e.g., “On 2025-02-16, variable X label changed from ‘Income (old)’ to ‘Income (annual)’ by user Y”). Another idea is versioning the metadata by date or release number, so one could recall the labels at a certain version of a harmonized dataset. While these are not immediate priorities, the system will be designed not to preclude such additions. That means the data structures for metadata (CSV columns, etc.) could include a version or timestamp if needed. At the very least, we ensure that updating variables.csv or variable_details.csv is controlled (e.g., through functions that could optionally record a version comment).

-   **Synchronization with data versions:** Often, changes in labels accompany changes in data (like new derived variables added, or categories merged). `recodeflow` might consider linking the version of the metadata with the version of the output data. For now, package versioning is our main handle; however, as multiple harmonization projects use `recodeflow`, each project might tag its own data release versions. We will ensure our label export functions can include the package version and date in the output (like in a codebook header), which indirectly captures the version context.

In conclusion, the versioning strategy for labeling is two-fold: maintaining package versions via GitHub (ensuring users know which features are available in their version of `recodeflow`), and planning for future metadata version tracking as an enhancement. We will continue with GitHub for the immediate needs (including possibly GitHub’s Projects or issues to track progress of the labeling feature ￼) and keep an eye on how to implement more granular label version tracking in a user-friendly way later on. Proper versioning guarantees that improvements to labeling are delivered in a clear timeline and that users can refer to documentation appropriate for their version of `recodeflow`.

## 7. Extensibility for additional metadata

While the primary focus is on labels, the design will allow extensibility to other metadata fields such as short vs. long labels, descriptions, and notes. We will incorporate these to complement the existing variables and variable_details structure, rather than overloading the R objects with extra attributes.

-   **Short and long variable labels:** Many datasets distinguish between a short label (a brief name) and a longer description. For example, a variable BMI might have a short label “Body Mass Index” and a long description “BMI, calculated as weight (kg) / \[height (m)\]\^2”. In `recodeflow`, we plan to support storing both. The variables sheet can have separate columns, e.g., label_short and label_long (or description). The short label would be what we treat as the “label” attribute in R (concise enough to show in a data viewer), while the long label/description would be stored only in the sidecar (and used for documentation generation like codebooks or when someone needs more context). This aligns with practices in codebook standards and IPUMS-like metadata ￼, where variable labels and descriptions are distinct fields. We will ensure the functions allow access to both (e.g., **get_variable_description(name)** might retrieve the long description). However, to keep the R object lightweight, we will not attach the full long description as an attribute to every vector (which could be quite large text). Instead, the long descriptions live in `variable_details` or variables tables and can be queried on demand.

-   **Additional fields (notes, sources, etc.):** The variable_details sheet already supports a Notes column (used to convey special instructions or cautions about the variable) ￼. We will continue to support this and similar fields. Notes are typically free-form text explaining quirks in recoding or definitions. Other metadata we may consider: data source, survey question text, units of measurement, allowed ranges, etc., depending on user needs. Our principle is to house this information in the sidecar metadata rather than in the main data structure. This is because the sidecar can be easily extended with new columns without affecting how the data frame operates in R. If we were to add every piece of metadata as an attribute to the data frame, it would become cumbersome to manage. It might bloat the object (and many R functions would ignore or drop those attributes anyway). Using the sidecar approach, we can add as many fields as needed (within reason) to variables.csv/variable_details.csv. For example, adding a units column for variables that have units (like “kg” for weight) could be done in the CSV, and `recodeflow` can have a `function get_units(var)` to retrieve it.

-   **Maintaining compatibility with sidecar structure:** We will not create a complex S3 class to hold all metadata in R at this time. Instead, the sidecar data frames (likely tibbles read from CSV) will remain the primary carriers of extensive metadata. This decision is due to resource constraints and also to maintain clarity – the `recodeflow` workflow already expects these sheets, so expanding them is natural. We will, however, provide convenient R accessors. Perhaps we will have an internal list or environment where the metadata tables are stored when loaded (for quick lookup), and methods to query them. But the raw storage stays as two data frames with defined columns. This also makes it easy to export the entire metadata in one go (since it’s basically those two tables).

-   **Functions for setting/getting metadata:** To manage these metadata fields, we’ll implement functions akin to:

    -   `set_variable_metadata(var, short_label=NULL, long_label=NULL, description=NULL, notes=NULL, ...)` that can take one or more metadata pieces and assign them (updating the sidecar and any relevant attribute, like the short label to the data).

    -   `get_variable_metadata(var)` which returns a list or tibble of all stored metadata for that variable (name, labels, description, etc.).

    -   Specific helpers like `set_notes(var, text)` or `get_notes(var)` for the Notes field, to encourage documentation of variables within R. These functions will abstract the underlying data structure (CSV or tibble), giving the user a clear API. Internally, they manipulate the variables/variable_details tables and possibly attributes. By doing this, we ensure efficiency (directly editing a data frame in memory and then writing out to CSV when needed) and reduce user error (it’s safer than manually editing the tables without guidance).

-   **Ensuring minimal coupling to data object:** Because we are not embedding all metadata in the data frame, we avoid issues with large attributes. The only attribute attached by default will be the short variable label and the value labels. Everything else (notes, long descriptions, etc.) stays in the sidecar. This keeps the data frame S3 object clean and focused, which is important given that some R functions drop unknown attributes. We will document that the full metadata is always available via `recodeflow`’s sidecar and functions, even if not attached to the data frame.

In summary, the label functionality is built with extensibility in mind: today it’s labels, tomorrow it could be definitions, provenance, etc. The design relies on the flexible sidecar metadata approach, avoiding heavy modifications to the core data object. This allows `recodeflow` to grow in metadata scope without large refactoring. We will maintain backward compatibility with projects that might not use new fields (extra columns can be optional), and ensure that any additional metadata fields do not break existing functions. By doing so, we keep `recodeflow` lean yet ready to capture rich data documentation as needed.

## 8. Technical documentation and usability

Clear documentation and sensible behavior are critical for user adoption of the new labeling features. We will provide comprehensive technical documentation and define how labels behave under various data transformations to ensure the feature is both machine-actionable and human-readable in practice.

-   **Documentation of expected behavior:** The package vignettes and function references will describe how labels are preserved or modified during common operations. For example, if a user uses `dplyr::mutate()` to create a new variable from labeled variables, what happens? We will specify that by default, new variables will have no label (unless the user explicitly sets one), and existing labels will carry over to unmodified variables. If an existing labeled variable is transformed (e.g., scaled or recoded), the label may be dropped because the content has changed – unless our function `recode_with_table` handles it internally. We will integrate with known behaviors; for instance, when using haven::as_factor() on a `labelled` variable, the result is a factor with levels corresponding to the value labels, but the variable-level label is usually lost in that conversion. Users should be aware of this. In cases where R’s native or tidyverse behavior might strip labels, we will mention it and often provide a workaround or our own function. A section of the vignette could be “Working with labeled data: do’s and don’ts”, covering things like subsetting (which retains labels on the subset), combining data frames, pivoting, etc.

-   **Preservation of metadata in transformations:** We will aim for labels to survive through data transformations as much as logically possible. For instance:

    -   **Joins:** If two data frames are joined (e.g., left_join) and both have a column with the same name but different labels, dplyr will suffix them (.x, .y) by default. We will recommend joining on a unique key to avoid clobbering two labeled columns into one. If join results in one column, we’ll preserve whichever label corresponds to the retained column (e.g., for left join, the left table’s label). A note will clarify that merging datasets with conflicting metadata should be handled by harmonizing metadata first.

    -   **Row-Binding (Appending):** If stacking two datasets (e.g., using bind_rows), and they have the same variables with labels, ideally those labels should be the same. We will note that if they differ, the resulting object will keep the label from the first dataset (or the one that sets the variable name). Consistency is expected as a prerequisite; we might even provide a utility to check that two datasets have the same labels before combining.

    -   **Pivoting:** For pivot_longer, where multiple columns (each possibly with its own label) become a single column, the new “mega-column” cannot carry all original labels. In such cases, we will likely drop those original variable labels but we might preserve them in the sidecar as part of the new variable’s long description (e.g., “This long variable was created from X, Y, Z which were labeled …, …, … respectively”). For pivot_wider, where one variable spreads into multiple, we can auto-generate labels for the new columns by combining the original label with the new column identifier. We will document what strategy we choose so that users know what to expect.

    -   **Filtering and Subsetting:** These operations do not remove or change labels on the columns themselves. If a filter results in no instances of a certain category, the value label for that category is still kept (since the category is still conceptually possible). However, if a user wants to drop labels for values that no longer appear, we will mention the use of functions like `labelled`::remove_val_labels() or an equivalent to clean up unused labels ￼. [forum.posit.co](https://forum.posit.co/t/leveraging-labelled-data-in-r-r-views-submission/114983). This will be left to user discretion, since automatically dropping could lead to loss of information.

-   **Exporting data with labels:** We will document best practices for preserving labels when exporting data. For example:

    -   When writing to CSV, labels are not included, so we suggest also exporting the variables.csv and `variable_details.csv` as the accompanying metadata, or using `recodeflow::write_csv_with_meta()` which could bundle data and metadata (e.g., as a zip with `data.csv` and `metadata.csv`).

    -   When writing to SPSS/Stata/SAS via `haven`, simply ensure the data frame has the proper classes and attributes (which our functions do) and then use `write_sav` or `write_dta` – the documentation will confirm that this process retains all variable and value labels.

    -   If converting to factors or numeric for analysis, advise how to keep labels elsewhere. For instance, one might want to convert a `labelled` categorical to factor to use in modeling. Doing so will drop the “labels” attribute in favor of factor levels. We will recommend using `haven::as_factor(labelled_var, levels = "label")` to turn it into a factor with the label names as factor levels, thereby preserving the label information in the factor itself. Alternatively, note that converting to numeric will strip labels entirely ￼, so one should save the value labels if needed for later interpretation.

    -   **Machine-actionable metadata:** We will ensure that the metadata remains structured and not just free text. The sidecar CSVs are machine-readable by design (tabular with known columns). We’ll also possibly provide a function get_codebook() that produces a structured list or JSON of all metadata, which could be used programmatically (for example, to feed into a report generator or to compare with another dataset’s metadata). Having structured metadata means other packages or scripts can consume `recodeflow`’s outputs. We will document the format of these structures so developers can build on them.

    -   **Human-readable documentation:** Alongside machine-readability, the metadata should be easily understood by humans. We will produce a vignette or article that essentially serves as a codebook for an example dataset, demonstrating how the variables and variable_details translate into readable documentation. Perhaps an R Markdown function will allow users to create an HTML or PDF codebook automatically from the metadata (this could be a future add-on). In any case, the fields (like “label”, “description”, “notes”) will be clearly explained in the user guide, so there is no ambiguity. We will use consistent terminology (for instance, always call it “variable label” vs “value label” to distinguish them, as in this document) so users can follow along.

    -   **Usability considerations:** All functions related to labeling will be designed to be user-friendly. This includes:

        -   Providing sensible defaults (e.g., if a user forgets to supply a variable label, maybe default to the variable name or leave it blank but issue a message encouraging labeling).

        -   Meaningful error messages (if one tries to label a non-existent variable, or if the labels vector provided doesn’t match expected types).

        -   Illustrative examples in documentation for each function, showing typical usage and edge cases.

        -   Ensuring that label-setting functions can work within pipes/workflows (for example, returning the data frame invisibly so you can do `df %>% set_variable_label(x, "Label for X") %>% further_processing())`.

By thoroughly documenting these behaviors and providing best practice tips, we aim to make the labeling feature both powerful and approachable. We will likely include an FAQ section in the vignette for questions like “Why did my labels disappear after using X function?” and answer that with explanations (often pointing out it’s how base R or dplyr works) and solutions (like reapply the labels or use `recodeflow` functions that preserve them). The combination of clear documentation, examples, and consistent function design will ensure that users can confidently apply and maintain labels through all stages of their data processing.

## 9. Potential challenges and open questions

Implementing the above functionalities comes with some challenges and open questions. We identify these potential issues and outline how we plan to address or investigate them:

-   **Label inheritance during transformations:** How should labels propagate when data is transformed? This is a complex issue since some transformations fundamentally change the meaning of a variable. Our approach will be to inherit labels when the transformation is identity-preserving, and drop or change labels when the variable’s meaning changes. For example, if you rename a variable, the label should carry over to the new name. If you create a new variable as a simple copy or combination (like concatenating two factors into one), perhaps you can combine labels. But if you compute a numeric transformation (e.g., log of income), the old label “Income” is no longer fully accurate; we might drop it or append “(log)” to it. We will carefully decide these on a case-by-case basis and document them. The challenge is to do this automatically without guessing wrong. As a guiding principle, no silent mislabeling: better to have no label than an incorrect one. We might also provide a utility to explicitly copy labels from one var to another (useful after manual transformations). This remains an open area where feedback will be gathered from users.

-   **Impact on large-scale datasets:** Maintaining labels in memory for very large datasets could introduce overhead. Even though labels are small per variable, a dataset with thousands of variables might have a sizable metadata footprint. We need to ensure that having lots of labels (and maybe long descriptions) does not strain R’s memory. One potential impact is on serialization: saving a labeled data frame (e.g., with saveRDS) includes all those attributes, which is fine, but if some labels are extremely long strings, it could inflate file size. We anticipate this is minor in most cases, but it’s worth monitoring. We will test `recodeflow` on large, multi-thousand variable data to see if performance slows or memory usage spikes, and if so, optimize accordingly (perhaps by trimming overly long labels in memory, or suggesting to users to not assign huge texts as attributes). Also, when dealing with many variables, functions like `var_label(data)` (that return all labels) should be efficient. If needed, we might add an index (like making variable name the row names of the sidecar for O(1) access). Scalability of the metadata system will be a constant consideration.

-   **Validation of label consistency:** Should `recodeflow` enforce or check that labels are consistent across related datasets or harmonization steps? Since one of its goals is to harmonize variables from multiple sources, an inconsistency in labeling might indicate a problem (e.g., one source’s “Gender” variable labels 1 as “Male”, another as “Female” – a serious discrepancy). We envision adding validation routines that can be run on the metadata. For instance, a function `check_metadata_consistency()` could scan through variable_details and ensure that for each harmonized variable, all source variables mapped to it had labels that make sense together (it might flag if the value labels differ in a way that suggests a coding mismatch). Similarly, it can ensure no duplicate labels within a variable (no two categories share the same text), and that no value is unlabeled if it should be, etc. These checks would help maintain data integrity. However, implementing this requires knowing the context (which `variable_details` provides). We will likely incorporate some checks when applying labels – for example, if two different label definitions are about to be merged into one, issue a warning. The extent of validation vs. flexibility is an open question; we will aim to find a balance, possibly making strict consistency checks optional.

-   **User experience vs. automation:** There is a general question of how much to automate label handling. Automatically carrying labels through every transformation can be helpful, but if done incorrectly it can cause confusion. We must decide where to draw the line so that the user stays in control. One challenge will be educating users that some operations inherently drop metadata (because of how R works) and that `recodeflow` can restore it if used properly. We will use the documentation and possibly message/warning outputs to guide this. For example, if a user uses a base R function that strips labels, we can’t intercept that, but we can in our own functions. Striking the right balance between magic (things just happen) and manual (user explicitly calls a function) is something we will refine through testing and feedback.

In conclusion, while the label functionality will greatly enhance `recodeflow`, these challenges need to be managed. Our development approach will include writing tests for tricky scenarios (joins, pivots, huge metadata, conflicting labels) to see how the system behaves and adjusting accordingly. We will also likely seek user feedback by releasing a beta version of the labeling feature to a small group or on a branch, to learn about any unforeseen issues. By anticipating these questions now, we can design the system to be robust yet flexible. Ensuring data integrity and ease of use is the priority, so whenever a conflict arises (like between convenience and correctness), we will choose the approach that preserves correctness and clarity in the metadata. All such decisions and any limitations will be transparently documented so that users can trust the label functionality and know its boundaries.
