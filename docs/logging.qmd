# Logging enhancement scope and specifications for cchsflow/recodeflow

## Summary

This document outlines plans to enhance logging capabilities in cchsflow and recodeflow while maintaining their core mission of enabling transparent and reproducible data transformations. The proposed enhancements will support better error reporting and debugging while preserving the packages' accessibility for new users.

## Scope

### Core requirements

Our packages must continue to enable reproducible data transformations through clear, self-contained functions. The logging system should enhance, not complicate, this primary goal.

1.  Maintain simple usage of transformation functions without mandatory logging
2.  Provide clear error messages and warnings for common issues
3.  Support advanced logging capabilities for power users
4.  Ensure compatibility with existing R workflows and tools
5.  Preserve compatibility with existing metadata management features

### Out of scope

1.  Direct integration with external pipeline tools
2.  Real-time log monitoring capabilities
3.  GUI-based log viewing tools
4.  Automatic metadata generation from logs

## Specifications

### Basic logging requirements

1.  Warning generation
    -   Clear, actionable warning messages that help users understand and fix issues
    -   Row-specific error identification where applicable, making debugging easier
    -   Basic error categorization that distinguishes between data validity, range violations, and other common issues
2.  Error handling
    -   Non-stopping error management that allows processing to continue
    -   Consistent use of tagged_na values for invalid results
    -   Preservation of data frame integrity during transformations
3.  Warning aggregation
    -   Clear summary of warning types and frequencies
    -   Identification of systematic issues across the dataset
    -   Optional detailed row-level reporting for debugging

### Advanced logging features

1.  Custom logging function support
    -   Optional log_fn parameter that defaults to R's warning function
    -   Consistent logging function interface for standardization
    -   Support for different logging levels while maintaining simplicity
2.  Metadata integration
    -   Clear connection between logs and variable metadata
    -   Documentation of transformation rules and their effects
    -   Support for existing label management system

### Implementation requirements

1.  Function design
    -   Clean, understandable default behavior
    -   Optional parameters for advanced logging that don't complicate basic usage
    -   Consistent interface across all transformation functions
2.  Performance considerations
    -   Minimal overhead for basic usage scenarios
    -   Efficient handling of large datasets without memory issues
    -   Memory-efficient log storage for extended processing
3.  Documentation requirements
    -   Clear examples showing basic usage patterns
    -   Progressive documentation that introduces advanced features naturally
    -   Examples showing how logging fits into typical workflows

## Context and considerations

### Design patterns and principles

The logging system follows established software design patterns that promote maintainability and flexibility while keeping the code accessible to R users who may not be familiar with formal design patterns.

#### Progressive disclosure

This pattern reveals complexity only as needed, making our functions approachable while supporting advanced use cases. For example, a new user might start with basic function calls:

```r         
result <- standardize_age(age_vector, units_vector)
```

As their needs grow, they can add custom logging:

```r
Copyresult <- standardize_age(age_vector, units_vector, 
                         log_fn = my_custom_logger)
```

#### Observer pattern
This pattern separates the core transformation logic from logging, allowing users to "observe" the process without changing it. This separation means we can enhance logging without touching the core transformation code.

#### Strategy pattern
This pattern allows different logging approaches through a consistent interface. Users can plug in their preferred logging strategy while our functions remain unchanged.

### R ecosystem compatibility
Our design prioritizes harmony with existing R workflows:

#### Base R compatibility
- Uses familiar warning() mechanism by default
- Follows R's standard approaches to error handling
- Maintains consistent behavior with base R functions

#### Tidyverse alignment
- Supports typical tidyverse programming patterns
- Maintains pipe-friendly interfaces
- Follows tidyverse naming conventions

#### External logging libraries
While we acknowledge the existence of established logging libraries like futile.logger and logger, our current focus is on providing essential logging capabilities without introducing additional dependencies. Users who prefer these libraries can integrate them through our custom logging function parameter.
[Example implementation section remains the same as before]
### Next steps

Review and refine specifications with team
Develop prototype implementations
Test with existing transformation functions
Gather user feedback on basic logging needs
Create documentation and examples
Plan phased rollout of enhancements

We should focus initially on implementing and testing the basic logging capabilities, ensuring they meet our core requirements before considering any advanced features or integrations.
