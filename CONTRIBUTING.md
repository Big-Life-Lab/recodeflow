# Contributing to recodeflow


## Filing an issue

The easiest way to propose a change or new feature is to file an issue. If you've found a bug, you may also create an associated issue. If possible, try to illustrate your proposal or the bug with a minimal [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex). When filing an issue, please use the issues template available on the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/recodeflow/issues).

## Pull request

*  Please create a Git branch for each pull request (PR). [Click here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for information on how to create a PR.
*  Your contributed code should roughly follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
*  recodeflow uses [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html),
for documentation.
*  recodeflow uses [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Adding tests to the PR makes merging the PR into the code base less prone to bugs.
*  If your PR is a user-visible change, you may add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` describing the changes made. You may optionally add your GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
